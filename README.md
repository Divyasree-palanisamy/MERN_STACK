# Quiz App - My First Frontend Project

This is my first complete web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this interactive quiz application to practice and showcase the frontend skills I've learned.

## About This Project

After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I wanted to build something fun and interactive. This quiz app lets users test their knowledge with multiple-choice questions and provides immediate feedback.

## What I Built

- **Interactive Quiz Interface** - Multiple choice questions with real-time feedback
- **Score Tracking** - Keeps track of correct answers and displays final score
- **Timer Functionality** - 60-second countdown for each quiz
- **Sound Effects** - Audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers
- **Progress Bar** - Visual indicator of quiz progress
- **Responsive Design** - Works on different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structure and content of the quiz
- **CSS** - Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Quiz logic, timer, scoring, and interactivity

## Project Structure

```
Quiz_app/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # CSS styling
├── script.js           # JavaScript functionality
└── sounds/             # Audio files
    ├── correct.mp3     # Sound for correct answers
    ├── wrong.mp3       # Sound for wrong answers
    └── complete.mp3    # Sound for quiz completion
```

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. Click "Start Quiz" to begin
3. Answer the multiple-choice questions
4. See your final score when the quiz ends
5. Click "Try Again" to take another quiz

## What I Learned

### HTML
- Creating structured, semantic markup
- Using proper form elements
- Making content accessible

### CSS
- Responsive design principles
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Animations and transitions

- Local storage for data persistence
- Audio API integration

## Challenges I Faced

- **Timer Implementation** - Getting the countdown to work properly
- **Responsive Design** - Making it look good on mobile devices
- **Audio Integration** - Adding sound effects without delays
- **Score Calculation** - Tracking and displaying results correctly
- **State Management** - Handling quiz flow and user interactions

## Code Highlights

### Timer Function
```javascript
function startTimer() {
    timer = setInterval(() => {
        timeLeft--;
        updateTimerDisplay();
        if (timeLeft <= 0) {
            endQuiz();
        }
    }, 1000);
}
```

### Question Display
```javascript
function displayQuestion() {
    const question = questions[currentQuestion];
    questionElement.innerHTML = `
        <h2>${question.question}</h2>
        ${question.options.map(option => 
            `<button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer('${option}')">${option}</button>`
        ).join('')}
    `;
}
```
